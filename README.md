This landing page is unique as it was the first project of javascript Bootcamp. This was made with purely HTML and CSS.
I learned about CSS selectors and poisoning. It is a non-responsive landing page. It took around one hour to build this. The challenge was to turn the design into code.
please take a look and give feedback. ðŸ¤“ <br>
